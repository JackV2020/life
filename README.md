### Toon Life

John Conway's Game of Life for your rooted Eneco Toon so you have this well known game on the wall.

You can select from the examples in a scrolling menu. On one of the screenshots below you see there are 14 examples. I am working on the app so the actual version may have more.
<br>You can also change the size of the grid and you may compose you own shape on the Life screen when you enable clicks.

The game has two modes.
<br>A 'Wrap' mode where the opposite sites of the grid are connected so objects can move off screen and come back on the other side and a 'Wall' mode where objects run into the edge of the grid and can not go further.

There is also a number of themes you can select from. The default is black and white. To select another theme you can click the 'Select Theme' button any time.

For a first impression see the screenshots below. Note that the 'Home' button in the left upper corner is hidden while the game is alive. The 'Home' button comes back when you click the 'Pause Life' button.


### Install the app

Maybe from the Toon Store but for now :

    - on Toon create a folder /qmf/qml/apps/life
    - put everything or at least the qml files and the drawables folder in the life folder
    - restart the GUI / reboot your Toon
    - add a tile for 'Life' ( hand pushing a button )

Thanks for reading and enjoy the Game of Life.
